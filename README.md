## How do you use the scripts?

Simply [Launch](Setup.bat)!

This game is impossible to beat, To win the game, Reach 200 Score level.

All you need is Python. I wrote this in Python 3.10.6, so I'd recommend you [install that version](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3106/). However, later versions should work too.
